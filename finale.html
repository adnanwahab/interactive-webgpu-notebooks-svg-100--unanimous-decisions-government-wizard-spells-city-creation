# morpheus - AGI Brochure for secret cabal goes in book

agi + (antenna/satellite)

make bubbles form pyramid, focus chain w/ three lines

communication network graph made of digital twin pseudonyms - alter ego for solving problems that reality can't solve

documenting progress so kids know they can contribute

66 years from wright brothers to apollo space mission

28 years from invention of netscape to next year webgpu launch date

get collaborators next year

dunbars number = each focus group can have 150 inter-connections tops

46,666,666 focus groups -

how would ai augment intellect of every "level"

digital twin + knowledge synthesis between tweens - pairwise + 1 ai per 150

people dont have to talk each other directly (but they can, mostly in person for fun)

but coordination for economic and poltical projects

anonymous, unanimous consesus, coordination and idea generation in detail and at a glance.

see flaws and **see solutions**

each brain has countless secret worlds and idea soup, but the electorate can poll each other and draw the best ideas for the individual to pursue instead of engaging in distraction.

then the individual just executes and its a matter of time before his life and familie's circumstances are improved in weeks.

bubbles and arcs like deckgl

the government is a headless chicken because the problems its trying to contain are too vast and complex to fit into any given head and the cost of coordination is so high that the government has to prioritize its own solvency over the happiness and

ideas change update too slowly because government is addicted to perpetuating its own power structures and ossifying the ideas of its constitutients.

what is the answer?

AI.

How can AI be used in a way that's harmonious

when i get inspiration from the electorate, i will run with that train of that like autocomplete.

the coolest part of morpheus is that it can autocomplete and augment your mind using cosmic future science technology.

amazon invented a satellite that can read your mind on dec 1. They are storing all thoughts in s3.

whats the data rate on all thoughts in s3

thomas jefferson said we need a revolution every 250 years. long overdue. our archaic power structures have barely adjusted in centuries. The people in government are incredibly intelligent, compassionate, and lucid, but they would be the first ones to complain about how difficult it is to change things.

the answer isnt just ai. because in order for technology to be effective it has to be human-first.

technology has to serve our true nature

universal 100% consensus on every decision is optimal.

it might be impossible but how would it work?

diagram!!

larp

make it a joke article but make the diagrams so informative and meaningful you'd think yes it will work. there is no way it could not work .

Be optimistic, positive and light,

opt-in + opt-out = federated identity = sanctity of the individual

timezones = synchronous lunch

3 meals , 3 max focus groups

wisdom of crowds + unanimous input of electorate

draw diagrams and get funding for wizards

How to get to 1 billion focus crystals faster

How to organize focus groups - worth diagramming to inform world of morpheus adding structure and meaning to people soup in isolated boxes commuting to boxes and doing unfufilling (50% underemployment)

must release book by 2pm

i am consulting for mckinsey-donalds like mark did for random new company called mind-magic-wizard-school
