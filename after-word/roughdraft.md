creator vs subject

protagonist vs author

engineer vs designer

foreground vs background

puppet vs puppeteer

audience vs co-collaborator → beauty of new paradigm

collaboration = everyone equal + collaboration = exponentiation + potentiation + subsidizing complements + T-shaped

you are all these and none of these. you are both and it depends if you had the free will to choose

repetition creates insight

repetiion = train endlessly but also go play outside and touch grass equal time to screen time

thich nhat hanh method - create for 30 minutes then go play for 30 minutes

you are a victim of a world that infantilizes that takes away autonomy, mastery, purpose

but you are a creator of a world that restores dignity back to the individual

cite bret victor - artists who paint with magic -ink

creator economy - show everyone analytics on book

our brain was designed to help us to survive

creations combine exponentially

creativity is just the combination of two things

make 1 billion multi-spec wizards
- information+motion designing
- AI-scientist
- compute shader script hackers
- using conversational voice to script AI which does engineering for you

skills needed:

webgpushaderlanguage

javascript enough to write json and functions

python enough to munge data on multicore

advanced beginner from eloquent javascript → fast.ai

use voice to bridge gaps

use sliders to bridge gaps

use papers to fill gaps in economy

make everyone a creator of their circumstances

an author of a story of their own design

make everyone a reflexive solipsist

your brain creates a simulation - water color eyes

above the line - managers handbook - how did i contribute to these circumstances

make everyone a creator not in the drama triangle ever - eliminate drama triangle

instead of consuming social media, you can create shiny 4D scenarios with AI + voice + lowcode

creator economy -

fix recruiting pipeline, instead of leetcode which trains you to solve contrived challenges, you can add a chapter to book and to your portfolio and improve one and

instead of protagonist, you are the author of a story in your own design

a character in an endless story of 100 billion humans creating the future

improve fang recruiting pipeline and childrens education, instead of reading

unanimous council of 5 that get unanimous input from 500 people using poll-everywhere clone in observable

copy dispersion and then do it as a front-facing cross-section with forces for 2d cup of water

subject-object

everyone wants immersion

make new paradigm

everyone a taoist, transcendent, science-realistic optimist - 5 years

- age when dreams→ reality - distance is shortened - time between implementation and usable application is less = rainbow gooo => explosion of useful AI applications => faster iteration => alan kay's dream becomes even more high res

mental constitution = memory +self trust from observing mind doing right action

present is culmination of last 7 million/billion years

breath is closest we can get to present moment

present moment = not thinking because thought is borne of time and from the past so knowledge is false

but knowledge is silver, perspective/understanding is gold and

psychedelics give you a short-window into enlightenment, but the moment it fades it only leaves with a picture of the possibility. it does not allow you to become the possibility. and we come down from the high the moment because our habitual thought patterns come back. ego = bundle of 100 thoughts we have a day. optimal consciousness = non-egoic thought that is adaptive to the situation at hand

enlightenement is a joke

partial or complete - there is no truth. humans can only approximate. we can only get asymptotically closer to the truth. data is as close to truth as it gets. recording of the universe at a particular point in time
- cite entropic brain - causes entropy and reduces constitution like sleep

optimistic - sci fi- positive and light

told us to use crispr as a test for yamato plants and to test telepathy for use with morpheus

told us to re-create the world

and is the only reason this book is possible

and if you're reading this then you're already a wizard-in-training and you're different from everyone who hasnt read this so show them

you're 50% responsible for family, friends, random strangers, the world and 100% responsible for self's actions

responsibility is cruicial for a harmonistic society

self = no self + everything you're connected to + body + mind

responsibility = greatest meaning

your rights are my responsiblity

right to freedom of expression

radical self responsibility by creating circumstances and enviornment

together we will create future cities in our backyards using robots and plants

make meaningful code which supports human condition by alleviating stress response and accelerating science which is the purpose of life after giving and receiving love to family which includes self

please edit zoox + self

last chapter visualize-mind-magic

designer in code + scientist is the ultimate spec - design your code, world, circumstance, life

life is made of the short term so create your life, win the day win your life

gottman thought world = key to collaboration

perfection does not exist which is why we get attached to it - esther perel

iteration speed is why wright brothers discovered flight

discovery is an organizational process and your 3rd purpose is to make the world more organized - said aliens

organization is power because then we know how to find things

wisdom = bringing more presence to the moment so

quote brian, abby, gil, ty, the body is a map for a mind so do more yoga and meditation and walking because thats where great ideas come from

ramdass = receptivity is True strength

edit out: paraphrase + concatenate + glue = writing skill

everyone is your friend. treat them as such and call them that - or brother/sister if they identify

respect is an action - bushido way - its the way you treat yourself two. communication goes both ways you are always programming yourself. so look at the way your mind edits experiences using biases < link visualize value - or redo in simple-webgpu

people grow from praise - praise the changing element in each person to reinforce the best in each other to create the circumstance you want

people grow from challenge and observation

dont outsource your thinking - make your own decisions and learn from each (result)

i was a student not long ago but the studio taught me how to become a self-teacher

all learning is self teaching and learning by doing. thats the key to becoming great

i am gifted and so are you - link to phonetic tricks from book and reference it

cheshire cat - link to reflect and use ANKI

think small - chocolate after exercise or coding to potentiate learning because brain likes being happy

last chapter = gap finding research paper to

reflect.app is amazing

this is your final chapter now the goal for you is to implement a research paper in observable or collabratory or gpu-paperspace or github and then score a sick job using my gap-finding and mentorship

you wont get a job at zoox but you can get a job anywhere else in the valley 

hybrid is the future
multi-generational households are the future 
remote is a privlegedge for very senior people and an earned reward for years of excellent service. 

krishnamurthi freedom from the mind - from negativity, fear and obsession

ego is bad. ego destroys. but you can keep identity small and keep it focused around creating great things using natural language and low-code-no-code.

tyranny of self-image connect to morpheus - need to be observed 

zoox please edit and add content, addendum, references, and so forth for self-learning but also learning more in school to become grand wizards who do research.

you only belong at zoox if you can implement research papers because we are raising the bar every day with every hire. 

zoox is the closest thing to xerox parc that i have found where the UI originated.

purpose of life is to give and recieve love. love what you do
2nd purpose is to observe without evaluation
evaluation = judgement.
appreciation = opposite of judgement.

optimal consciousness = 20 min with parents in the morning 
treat your teachers well and get the most out of school because it only comes once. 
self-learning is the path to mastery because schools can only teach whats scalable. 
schools are limited but you get out of them what you put into it. 
School may be remembered as the best time of your life if you do it wrong.

schools are just for socializing and for learning the best ideas and for research which i love doing without having gone to school. i wish i went to school more but now im just to busy or id totally go back

paul graham said you can be a 100x engineer if you work with the right people who are easiest to find in school or at your job because you need people who are super motivated and at a similar skill level

collaboration = ability squared because complements magnify - you can't do anything useful alone because all the good ideas are used up. but the hard or seemingly impossible ones are waiting for people who know how to collaborate.
