"After you solve the biggest problem, something else becomes the biggest problem." â€“ Balaji Srinivasan

A truth that is universally difficult to confront.

To make progress, we must solve harder and harder problems in sequence.

Even without the concept of progress, this statement is true.

To look forward is to look forward to the next problem.
