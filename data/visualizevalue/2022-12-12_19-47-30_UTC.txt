"Inspiration is perishable, act on it immediately." – Naval Ravikant

To better understand this idea, consider the contrast between the two concepts ancient Greeks used to think about time:

Chronos — the chronological passage of time.

Kairos — the right, critical, or opportune moment.

The best analogy I've heard for Kairos: an archer waiting for the perfect moment to release an arrow in order to hit a target.

Too early, you miss, too late, you miss.

Often, timing is more important than time.
