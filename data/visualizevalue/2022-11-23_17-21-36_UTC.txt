"Clockvvork"

The first physical Visualize Value artwork, for exhibition at Art Basel 2022.

A modified 100-year-old IBM punch clock that was designed to keep time, both literally and metaphorically.

This piece is an exploration of how we measure, think about, and use our time.

A collaboration with #timetobehappyart for #artbasel.
