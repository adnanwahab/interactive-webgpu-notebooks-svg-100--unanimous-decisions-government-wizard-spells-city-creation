"Judge each day not by the harvest you reap but by the seeds you plant." – William A. Ward

If you are building something, it is far more useful to focus on the work you are doing to produce the result than the result itself.

This is not to say there is no benefit to understanding the feedback loop between what you do, and what happens as a result of what you do. Of course there is.

The point here is, in almost anything worth having, there exists a long gap between input and outcome.

"The day you plant the seed is not the day you eat the fruit." – Fabienne Fredrickson
