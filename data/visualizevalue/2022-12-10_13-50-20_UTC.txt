"Prosperity is simply time saved." â€“ Matt Ridley

A quote from the introduction of Rational Optimist. 

This aptly named book argues the case for the inevitability of human progress.

Rational Optimist cites both hard data and invites readers to reconsider the accuracy of their nostalgic feelings for times stripped of the comfort and conveniences we take for granted today.

A semi-sequel to the foundational economic principles outlined by Adam Smith in Wealth of Nations, Rational Optimist confirms the accuracy of Smith's 250-year-old predictions.

Our ability to specialize, design goods and services, and trade amongst ourselves is the driving force behind a macro trend of exponential increases in quality of life.
