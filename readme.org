use static site like soul-wire.co.uk 
so it always works and anyone can contrib an observable 
or hand written page one folder at a time 

react-server-side-rendering - reusable head + styles

each folder one page 
table 

only need SEO + reusable styles on 
make users use a imported stylesheet with tailwind 
and basics that hides unnnecesary stuff from obs

workflow -> 
learn react and obfuscated garbage
include a script tag with a src="../toggle-able-header-at-top.js"
append a div at top
append styles 

book has to be server side progressive enhancement


export 

1 million notebooks from observable from all stream 
1 billion users will appreciate your convert-obs-to-interactive-shader-book.js

use iframes for now 

add a make file or a node script or a python script that adds SEO stuff + link backwards to table of contents 





this wiki book is designed specifically to unbundle governments, restore dignity to the individual, implement UBI, build future-hollistic-carbon-zero cities, and improve education so children can leapfrog and start researching the best of the frontier of science and art

tell governments how to upgrade their consciousness by co-inventing antennas
for public conscumption of AGI + telepathy

TODO add spreadhsheet of collaborators/editors/emails/observablehq

every job is a practice for the next one so do your best and make cool modules to get the best one that i know you can get

by reading this book, we have changed your fate and you are destined for Greatness. I can see your future and i know you better than you know yourself. 

by contributing to this book you have made my dreams come true and yours too.

the point of zoox is to reuse self-driving car knowledge to enrich the next generation to make a million unicorns and lots of robotics-scientists to make AGI
cars are only the beginning, at zoox we will create armies of robots to rebuild and empower the earth

make your code more meaningful by making it literate so you remember wtf it was doing and 

this book is g-rated and meant for the advanced beginner and hidden genius within everyone but especially kindergarderners because the simpler the code the better the author because the easier it is to understanding
simplicity is the mark of true skill. 
make something worth forking and watch the world transform


start before they are conditioned by school to give up
but also inspire everyone to keep going is the goal. 

together we can reinvent the earth

we have 2500 geniuses, its the first company i came into where i felt not even average. - shel bernstein

together we can correct the market ineffecienes, augment human intelligence to be super-human, change cities and remove information assymetries with GNU code

keep energy positive + light

this is gutenberg's printing press of the future using webGPU to use diagrams to potentiate knowledge and wisdom of BUDDAH
buddah could not awaken the world. he awoke himself because he had no shadows. 
but using technology of meditation and applied mind-magic we can awaken ourselves and free ourselves from the torment of the mind 

egolnessnes is a false jewel that makes you believe youre enlightened when you're not

we can harmonize spritiuality with AI, and call it mind-magic. 
we can harmonize technology with our True Nature and call it humanist technology

Glossary 
Nature = Everything = God 
Mind = Pinnacle of Reality
Music = idk harmonies - music theorists please make fugue visualizations 
Spirituality = refine mind
Truth = Reality as it is without belief 
Data = closest thing to Truth
Humans can never capture the Truth, they can only get asymptotical 

part 0 = kill math basics (study linear algebra, statistics+probability+naive bayes+stochastic gradient descent, real analysis, trig)
part 1 = [AI, data visualization, simulation]
part 2 = Visualizing the Human Mind or Brain [NeuroScience, Spirituality, Math]
part 3 = world transforming mind = robots rebuild earth + genomics create arcology cities

Each chapter needs a research paper to proof ideas

self-teachers are too practical, but be a pragmatic implementator
academics tend to be too ivory tower and reductionist and dogmatic and afraid of showing their code .

papers-with-code is the answer
make observable into papers with code and make a book out of it. thats observable's purpose

together we can make observablehq displace wikipedia by keeping this collection of documents universally resonant.

I want every line and character to be scrutinized closely by every single person at zoox. 

No PR gets approved until it has 2500 +1s or unanimous consensus and resonance across 500 constituents for 5 editors who are voted in and replaced yearly. 


This book is to upgrade the education for the next generation so they can make AGI and correct the world in ways that we could not. They are more capable than they believe and its our responsibility to show it to them,

i know half of you are bored while the government is approving the car to be released. 

This 20% time project will create extreme cross pollination between us and other walled gardens.

We can dissolve the boundaries between companies, eliminate duplication of work and crystallized human effort like modules and create a better more harmonious.


If we can work together on this book series, we can do anything. I believe in you. if you use the capabilities i have bestowed upon you then you are limitless far beyond the design of god. 




maslowes' hierarchy of needs - world actualization beyond self actualization  - inverted pyramid - alan kay's PDF

stream's goal is to unify worlds and train 7 billion data science wizards plus 1 billion graphics visualization engineers 

there's no limit to what engineers can create when they get the right design 

everyone is the limitless human by overcoming and understanding the source of their condition

the source is the bedrock foundation from which all problems occur

the Truth is the bedrock foundation 

the atomic structure, the nucleus of the atom, the mathematical formula, the behavior of nature

the truth can never be captured by language, or a charcoal etching 


make it positive sci fi, optimistic realistic and workism(enjoy every breath because life is a mysterious miracle which we have not yet figured out)

collaboration means democracy, and universal acceptance or ideally resonance. 
resonance is defined by as many subminds and processes agreeings as possible.
