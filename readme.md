# Visualize Mind Magic - Simple Staircase to 100x engineer/designer
We specialize in the emerging potential of the web platform.
We are designing the continuance of a nascent computational medium pioneers by redblobgames.com, pudding.cool and distil.pub

*** what book would you want everyone in the world to read

use static site like soul-wire.co.uk 
so it always works and anyone can contrib an observable 
or hand written page one folder at a time 

react-server-side-rendering - reusable head + styles

each folder one page 
table 

only need SEO + reusable styles on 
make users use a imported stylesheet with tailwind 
and basics that hides unnnecesary stuff from obs

workflow -> 
learn react and obfuscated garbage
include a script tag with a src="../toggle-able-header-at-top.js"
append a div at top
append styles 

book has to be server side progressive enhancement


export 

1 million notebooks from observable from all stream 
1 billion users will appreciate your convert-obs-to-interactive-shader-book.js

use iframes for now 

add a make file or a node script or a python script that adds SEO stuff + link backwards to table of contents 





this wiki book is designed specifically to unbundle governments, restore dignity to the individual, implement UBI, build future-hollistic-carbon-zero cities, and improve education so children can leapfrog and start researching the best of the frontier of science and art

tell governments how to upgrade their consciousness by co-inventing antennas
for public conscumption of AGI + telepathy


* put images here

0. do not do that which create aversion - grow towards light
1. unification + federated identity + opt-in-out communication morpheus focus groups
2. water slides and free time for everyone + robots and AI+technology for limitless productivity 
    how does technology enhance capabilities of the mind ? - speech to text - do what i mean
3. harmony with nature rather than working against - equilibrium etc


1. pixel grid - magi system
2. morpheus focus groups - webgpu particle system - (webgl prototype) (hierarchy, circle, sierpinsiki pyramid, megaphone)
3. world - satellitle orbit - rotate saetellitle around planet to relay thoughts in a loop around people .-0-.
4. finish these all in one day then go back to framework
5.  diagrams for "civic control center" 
6. maps with emotional valence of every citizen - see disturbance in the force - robot baby sitter = people watching map

everyone please add most interesting data sets imaginable including synthetic datasets like scraped amazon authors and the date and age they made their best creation which i thought was 45-60 because Jiro never stopped peaking at 96

TODO add spreadhsheet of collaborators/editors/emails/observablehq

every job is a practice for the next one so do your best and make cool modules to get the best one that i know you can get

by reading this book, we have changed your fate and you are destined for Greatness. I can see your future and i know you better than you know yourself. 

by contributing to this book you have made my dreams come true and yours too.

the point of zoox is to reuse self-driving car knowledge to enrich the next generation to make a million unicorns and lots of robotics-scientists to make AGI
cars are only the beginning, at zoox we will create armies of robots to rebuild and empower the earth

make your code more meaningful by making it literate so you remember wtf it was doing and 

this book is g-rated and meant for the advanced beginner and hidden genius within everyone but especially kindergarderners because the simpler the code the better the author because the easier it is to understanding
simplicity is the mark of true skill. 
make something worth forking and watch the world transform


start before they are conditioned by school to give up
but also inspire everyone to keep going is the goal. 

together we can reinvent the earth

we have 2500 geniuses, its the first company i came into where i felt not even average. - shel bernstein


document 3 phenomena :
client-side AI
webgpu
the MIND > GOD

together we can correct the market ineffecienes, augment human intelligence to be super-human, change cities and remove information assymetries with GNU code

keep energy positive + light

the only emotion you allow yourself to have from now on is reason and passion


visualize all mental models especially critical mass

link to wittgensteins - everything can be deconstructed
extend self transforming mind to world-transorming mind 

this is gutenberg's printing press of the future using webGPU to use diagrams to potentiate knowledge and wisdom of BUDDAH
buddah could not awaken the world. he awoke himself because he had no shadows. 
but using technology of meditation and applied mind-magic we can awaken ourselves and free ourselves from the torment of the mind 

egolnessnes is a false jewel that makes you believe youre enlightened when you're not
after enlightenement, chop wood carry water

chop wood = do stuff for community
carry water = idk whatever you want

goenka is cool too im going to goenka camp march 26

we can harmonize spritiuality with AI, and call it mind-magic. 
we can harmonize technology with our True Nature and call it humanist technology
dont forget, smartphones are like cigarettes

Glossary 
Nature = Everything = God 
Mind = Pinnacle of Reality
Music = idk harmonies - music theorists please make fugue visualizations 
Spirituality = refine mind
Truth = Reality as it is without belief 
Data = closest thing to Truth
Humans can never capture the Truth, they can only get asymptotical 

part 0 = kill math basics (study linear algebra, statistics+probability+naive bayes+stochastic gradient descent, real analysis, trig)
part 1 = [AI, data visualization, simulation]
part 2 = Visualizing the Human Mind or Brain [NeuroScience, Spirituality, Math]
part 3 = world transforming mind = robots rebuild earth + genomics create arcology cities

Each chapter needs a research paper to proof ideas

self-teachers are too practical, but be a pragmatic implementator
academics tend to be too ivory tower and reductionist and dogmatic and afraid of showing their code .

papers-with-code is the answer
make observable into papers with code and make a book out of it. thats observable's purpose

together we can make observablehq displace wikipedia by keeping this collection of documents universally resonant.

I want every line and character to be scrutinized closely by every single person at zoox. 

No PR gets approved until it has 2500 +1s or unanimous consensus and resonance across 500 constituents for 5 editors who are voted in and replaced yearly. 


This book is to upgrade the education for the next generation so they can make AGI and correct the world in ways that we could not. They are more capable than they believe and its our responsibility to show it to them,

i know half of you are bored while the government is approving the car to be released. 

This 20% time project will create extreme cross pollination between us and other walled gardens.

We can dissolve the boundaries between companies, eliminate duplication of work and crystallized human effort like modules and create a better more harmonious.


If we can work together on this book series, we can do anything. I believe in you. if you use the capabilities i have bestowed upon you then you are limitless far beyond the design of god. 




maslowes' hierarchy of needs - world actualization beyond self actualization  - inverted pyramid - alan kay's PDF

stream's goal is to unify worlds and train 7 billion data science wizards plus 1 billion graphics visualization engineers 

there's no limit to what engineers can create when they get the right design 

everyone is the limitless human by overcoming and understanding the source of their condition

the source is the bedrock foundation from which all problems occur

the Truth is the bedrock foundation 

the atomic structure, the nucleus of the atom, the mathematical formula, the behavior of nature

the truth can never be captured by language, or a charcoal etching

how to write a map with lots of data
how to write a particle simulation
how to write a hand writing neural net
how to redesign your mind/fate with learning about unconscious biases

how to program an AI with voice and a nodegraph with compute shaders
how to import a server-side trained model into the browser for more intelligent applications

how to implement/design the hardware needed to drive a car with robotics - 5 parts
simulation, planning, control, prediction, perception

# purpose of course
get kindergarderners to play with simulations and learn cool stuff with sliders
inspire the advanced beginners with a clear staircase to build their dreams at a startup or their dream job
give self-learners a path to get a job by learning new skills that are useful
get self-learners a job with giving research papers to spike on for companies
improve scientific and computer education in schools and student-teacher relationships by showing kids why to learn science (make cool stuff)

mixture of visualize-value, SICP, cs183, fast-ai.
get observable + reflect taught in school (mindmap-tony-buzan)

## how to learn
find the source of the source of your teachers - walk up chain of logic/distillation cause lots of stuff gets lots in translation
example : d3 -> heer -> immens
example: yoga -> bhagvad gita or yoga-> taoism/

the meaning of hardship is that  you can use it to understand more and create more wisdom
so you can transfer it to the next generation so they have easier, better lives 

we can do this using visualization and 4d graphics in the browser to make the world a better place to live.

i want the world to teach itself more - and for people to help me teach so everyone's smarter
world has information overload - making sense of that information = magic 
AI = magic because it helps make sense of world that is beyond logic because logic is sometime incomplete.
absolutes and generalizations are useful and somewhat-necessary because they save time or else you'd just remain confused
brain is not a truth machine, but its the closest thing we've got. 
you're not the mind, you have one and it has properties 
cure all malladies of the mind with a software upgrade - we can finish what krishnamurthi and buddha could not.
I can't do it alone.
We only need 600 bonfire creators to fix wikipedia's lack of interactive content which can illustrate and demonstrate what images alone cannot.

# glossary
mind magic = AI + the computer as extension to the mind + fact that mind can do math
culture = miracle that we all understand the same things 
smarts = amount of useful knowledge in head, including ability to create new useful knowledge 


# goal 
teach collaboration skills by finding out what they are and clearly defining them better than any where else 
gottman-thought-world
make a course for advanced beginners 
make everyone a 100x engineer/designer/scientist

engineer skills -
   refactoring for simplfiication - example = rawWEBGPU-> framework code -> knowing stack at all levels and tweaking each part to be 10x simpler

meta-self-programming - to be defined 



The unabomber thought impossible problems would be too hard and all the medium problems were used up
easy problems are all done
medium problems are taken by other people
impossible problems are now solvable using collaboaration which is the ultimate skill
there are a lot of smart people mad at the world because the world isnt good enough

theres millions of disefranchised people like 

make 1 billion wizards
Advanced prgamatic philosophy for hackers 

5 modules for now
1. big data visualization 
2. using speech to instruct AI to make computer graphics

technology solves the human condition by creating freedom from the mind
technology has an inherently spiritual bent because it extends the mind 
together we can make 7 billion buddah+alan kay hybrids

# make simple staircase to 100x engineer - paul graham
1. work hard to understand best ideas of other people and create your own for other people to cherish.
2. make something people want
3. make map that shows noisest neighborhood/hexagon in multiple resolutions

there's no limit to the demand for design and engineering 
we could have 10x as many 100x designers/engineers making star-forges, fusion and cure cancer.
We don't have enough talent. Thats why it takes so long to build things and thats why most things are filled with bugs.

It's your job to find the limits of the system and remove them.
The system is everywhere you go. Everything you touch. It is the state of the world 
Make an homage to the matrix and say you can change the code of the systems that govern the behavior of the world's systems. 

You can create things for billions of people to consume. Observablehq can get more viewers than netflix. 

The world is changing. Think of tiktok overtaking instagram. The future belongs to creators. Who stitch together the ideas of others and remix them into wonderous creations. 

it may be comforting to think it was inevitable but it wasnt.
if you think you have infinite free will, then you have more than you think - menno henselman
Think of designing in code as a new art form, and you can use it to shape the world.

psychedelics will cause the recession to end permanently, because they will instigate a surge in progress by making the mind more optimal, malleable, and ductile. The mind wants to expand infinitely - kyle henry.

I'm starting this school for everyone to become gifted and talented at whatever subspeciality of AI-driven art you choose to create.

This school is designed to teach you how to create AI-Scientific-Art Tools to create your dreams automagically for you using armies of robots.
