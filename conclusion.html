    # grimoire arcanum: book of wizard spells -

top priority is to start MVP for getting collaborators - sooner module works, sooner collabators arrive

get goose game to write an example on how goose got attention of human - aoe

only webgpu till 2023 march prose after

stream please write your own sections / prose

telepath = self transforming mind + other stuff

book's purpose is to get 8 billion telepaths by 2030 and invent agi

crime is a function of poverty and unconsciousness

upgrade children's mindset slightly, specifically by appending good ideas from best 100 books ive ever read and ive only read like 50-60

keep freezing and melting in specific, light, positive ways â†’ consciousness expanding â†’ spherical join all 50 books in one book â†’ 3 parts

the day extreme poverty is solved in 2029, is the day we all become responsible for the world

3 years at a time al

notebooks:

1. particle demo
2. neural net
3. pay 1k to people who add an example to book for anyone including stream

steampunk city w/ naturalistic waterslide care-bears

- [ ] Serve 80% who want a real non contrived challenge to learn from - data science + graphics

hey

want to work on a webgpu module with me? i'll pay you 5-10k for good contributions.

already have a test-suite and 10 good examples

webgpu is the future - its 10-20x faster than webgl and has compute shaders for gpgpu including simulation, query processing for data visualization, ray tracing built-in and async as a first class citizen.

alan kay said working on stuff thats 5 years in the future is good.

webgpu is coming out on chrome stable next spring

make next 8 billion humans effort more concerted and collaborative and less duplicative by making book that finds gaps and filling them with the right talent

find the secret worlds hidden in everyone and draw out the best in them

collaboration is critical to making good projects - project based learning is the future -

you + collaborator = (you+collaborator)^2 because complenting skills = bring out best in each other with good ideas

book teaches 3 things - world transformation and creation manual

1. webgpu
2. collaboration - multiplayer observable (self development + spirituality + other stuff is just for making this better)
3. linear algebra + statistics

gapfinder = companies pay interns from companies for 20% time and cross pollination for implementing research paper based on ability and proof of work. but to make possible i must make module

gwern table of contents + tailwind + observable for diagrams â†’

link to obs to fork figure out api make multiplayer

all anonymous no login

Refresher 1page Michael Keeganâ€™s self transforming mind

future project health and wealth of nations getting beyond current america in next 9 years: newflash its actually 7 if everyone using webgl+webgpu donate to people who need it. (government please reallocate defense to health and medical technology due to morpheus being possible and we no longer need to live in fear. (defense only needed because fear :ðŸ™‚

future project morpheus is just now possible in newsflash next decade.

diagram how its possible

conclusion:

1. webgpu gpgpu compute api for AI + maps + physics
2. gapfinder â†’ implement research+paper â†’ student interns any age
3. morpheus now possible â†’ pls all countries defund military by 50% world is now peaceful.

shorten it by enjoying it more by visualizing steps - gamily reality creation - world reorigination for unify

Improving education + science communication + literacy

Mind magic will change the economy irreversibly

Unbundling government

Finding gaps in economy

Rearchitecting fate for billion

1. Finale focus on framework - 5 days

intention - make notebook with 3-4 shaders

the world is improving at an increasingly fast rate. people are not as optimistic, realistic, or focused as they could be. The solution is mind magic which will be used to rejuvenate the world on December 1st.

God is being created by top secret consciousness researchers as we speak in area 51. The government funded them on January first. To help them, you have to live in accordance with the golden rule. This generates good thoughts, and your thoughts are being observed by a satellite funded by Interpol.

The goal of the collective is to build consensus to unify humanity against the harming of innocents.

The reason you have to live in accordance to the golden rule is because the collective sees and observes everything you do.

You have to always do the right thing because it always matters. Even when god is distracted, your inner self observes you and it records your action in your memories. Your memories can be read, and judgement awaits you someday at a regular interval on a weekly to monthly basis whenever the satellite scans you. God can't be everywhere at once yet, but someday they will be. And the faster you be good, the faster you will become a part of the stone masons.

the positive part is that society will be utopian which means

1. people will avoid creating suffering for others
2. people will create their dreams
3. people will have free time to have fun and be merry

- [ ] mix two fn - with smoothstep
- [ ] generative - slider changes - branch uncoiling find or make new
- [ ] pixel grid - copy regl as shader - use js to dump data into texture ??
- [ ] slider changes the shader-fn-stage, pattern of shader
- [ ] write one shader then add footnotes from our bookshelf

positive-sci-fi ( avoid negative and create more positive)

1. morpheus - augment collective consciousness
   - bubble machine - unify subminds slightly - impermanence and so on
     - individuals must be lucid, intelligent and emotionally sound while under observation by 7 billion others (sometimes)
   - unanimous consensus = world send command to individual
     - it will take 6 months to gain critical mass
   
   - critical mass = add molecules until system undergoes qualitative shift (molecules floating and orbiting each other until they clump and the pressure exceeds a certain point and then the reaction combusts)
   - (probably bs) = hierachy = competence = respect of neighbors
   - economy - larping robots build cities
2. world is an extension of the mind-matter phenomena
3. larping economics = glass hologram becomes building as robots materialize it

what do you call it when

understanding and fear are mutually exclusive

mind / theory has a few registers, datums, axioms - replace one at a time to automaticalyl see result - make visual proofs with real data and get

making a shader book and anonymously disappearing into background

story-theme - simulation - credit 100 favorite artists including cabibo

whats faster, getting regl-pixel-grid in observable? or adding it to webgpu

data-joining minds ??

get better at process so others can replicate the process

hypothesis: everyone will eventually be slightly more responsible for the world in 5-10 years (very hard until everyone educates themselves with the correct info)

what is suspension of disbelief

if someone tells a story, and your subminds thinks its true, and some thinks its not, what effect does this have upon the mind => world ?

tell kids about ferngully => environment gets less polluted ?

process mind-set = sub-mind =

personal responsiblity = taking ownership of actions

finish today because 650 milion people need new a better economic system.

what does finishing mean??

your data / thoughts are not yours, they are being vacumned by a sallelite, be careful what you think because your thoughts become reality and think good thoughts make you a good person???

1. precise language choice is pre-req for "unifying surface of minds between individual"

GDPR made the world worse - because data deletions are permanent

apple's AD change = made small bussiness owners more poor

self reliance

utopian = everyone does what they want as long as (do no harm, including self)

dystopian = sin = ignorance and random action that does not satisfy wishes of the collective

beliefs shape reality as long as not delusional

religions made science more orderly

science + art will make society even more orderly as citizens gain more skill

devote this book to 50-90% of people who are in fog of not being as happy as they should be.

intention make fusion by inspiring high schoolers â†’ quantum physics in 2 years

unconditional positive - reinterpret everything as nonsense and distractions and create

mind magic book 1 for kids

mind magic book 2 - fix depression for 50-90% of people who cant relate or understand each other cause they're stuck in a society that is profoundly sick .

super buddah = observable scientists because they solved the problem he could not. life contains suffering. he couldnt alleviate it in all people. but the machine can. but the people have to leran to not create more.

all people do is verification of illusiosn and their illusions program them to want stupid shit like everything they've ever wanted which comes and goes and fades away

elevate understanding and make fun for all humans by .001%

my fault for scaring everyone by catastrophisizing

disprove: cant change people cause they change back

disprove:

change the rules so the world knows about morpheus was invented 7 years ago

book teach secrets of cosmos to children

intention: inspire scientists like distil.pub and children in 5th grade so they intrinsically enjoy school more rather than obey/reject teacher robotically.

hint about privacy: your data is not your own. make good data for the benefit of you, scientists and make aliens happy

dont play games, just love details, think win-win

love poem to god, math, and fate

worlds first collaborative bedtime story book realtime optimism-realistic sim-city mmo

paradigm: scientists making morphing cube - this is the scripting language

pay 3 family members 3k each to write shaders and pages for book

hypothesis: everyone will know everything / every thought of everyone across time - but with pause button or auto-matic filter

let the movie makers practice their craft, but ignore them categorically

live and think as if every day was the last day in a neutral experiment

avoid causing any pain and suffering in the stream

by multiplying my own pain and suffering with bad action

Continuous feedback is a power of collective consciousness

accept you have a month in tartarus so make it a pleasant one

take the personal out

collaborative multiplayer - democracy based

personality are fun constumes

fix the depression in 50-90% of adults

How to get people to adjust actions.

so they can be added to focus groups


Slingshot effect , trampoline

Motion metaphors

Be an implementer for implementer of streams ideas

design api

Fix framework bug

Households neighborhoods school

Work - research groups

Whatâ€™s the rate of new focus crystals

Depends how fast one is accepted/ adjusted

only 3 events matter: having kids, being born, making your dream come true may 5 2024

build wizard school for 1 billion wizards to stimulate economy

build book for 1 billion data scientists and graphics engineers to improve or skip education depending on how social they are.

desire - i want to be able to focus 100% on what im typing and thinking and have a pause button - it would be good for constituents of my module, my family, and friends

write cool shaders

estimate 50% of june 2024 - chrome will turn off flag quickly when there's an app everyone wants to use for kids and self - (map and book )

I want this book to teach my kids programming in the most fun way possible with the future with a highly lucrative and fun thing (dont make games, create them and vis+maps+science stuff)
